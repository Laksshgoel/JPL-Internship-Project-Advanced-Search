# My Streamlit and FastAPI Application

This project is a web application that utilizes FastAPI for the backend and Streamlit for the frontend. The application is designed to demonstrate how to create a full-stack application using these two powerful frameworks.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your machine.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-streamlit-fastapi-app
   ```

2. Set up the backend:
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory:
     ```
     cd backend
     ```
   - Install the backend dependencies:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. Set up the frontend:
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
     ```
     cd ../frontend
     ```
   - Install the frontend dependencies:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the FastAPI backend:
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory and run:
     ```
     uvicorn app:app --reload
     ```

2. Start the Streamlit frontend:
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:
     ```
     streamlit run app.py
     ```

### Usage

Once both the backend and frontend are running, you can access the Streamlit application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`. The frontend will interact with the FastAPI backend to fetch and display data.
